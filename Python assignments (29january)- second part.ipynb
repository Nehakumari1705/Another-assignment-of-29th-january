   "source": [
    "#### Ans- Memory management in Python is handled automatically through a combination of garbage collection and reference counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a private heap space to manage its memory. Whenever an object is created in Python, a piece of memory is allocated on the heap to store the object. When the object is no longer needed, the memory is deallocated and returned to the heap for reuse. This process of allocating and deallocating memory is managed by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the heap, Python uses reference counting to manage memory. Reference counting keeps track of the number of references to an object. Whenever an object is referenced by a variable, the reference count for that object is incremented. When a reference to an object is removed or goes out of scope, the reference count for that object is decremented. When the reference count for an object reaches zero, the object is no longer needed and its memory is deallocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also uses a garbage collector to manage memory. The garbage collector runs periodically to reclaim memory that is no longer being used by the program. The garbage collector looks for objects that have a reference count of zero and frees their memory.\n",
